# Diagnostic Error Code E6000

## Use of Moved Value

### Description

This error occurs when you try to use a value after it has been moved. In Aster's ownership system, values can be moved from one location to another, and after a move, the original location becomes invalid.

### When Values Are Moved

Values are moved when:
1. They are assigned to a new variable
2. They are passed to a function (unless the type implements Copy)
3. They are returned from a function

### Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello"
    let t = s       // s is moved to t
    print(s)        // Error: s has been moved
}
```

### How to Fix

**Fix 1: Use a reference instead of moving**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello"
    let t = &s      // Borrow instead of move
    print(s)        // OK: s is still valid
}
```

**Fix 2: Clone the value**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello"
    let t = s.clone()  // Create a copy
    print(s)           // OK: s is still valid
}
```

**Fix 3: Use after move**
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello"
    let t = s
    print(t)        // Use t instead of s
}
```
