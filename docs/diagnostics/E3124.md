# Diagnostic Error Code E3124

## Cannot Unify Types

### Description

This error occurs when the type checker cannot reconcile two types that are expected to be the same. Type unification is the process by which the compiler determines if two types can be considered equivalent.

### Common Causes

1. Assigning a value of one type to a variable of an incompatible type
2. Returning a value from a function that doesn't match the declared return type
3. Passing arguments to a function that don't match the parameter types
4. Mismatched types in conditional expressions (if/else branches)

The compiler uses Hindley-Milner type inference to deduce types automatically, but when explicit type annotations conflict with inferred types, this error occurs.

### Example

```rust
// Error: cannot unify i32 and string
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = "hello"  // string cannot be unified with i32
}
```

### How to Fix

**Fix 1: Use correct type**
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42
}
```

**Fix 2: Change the type annotation**
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: string = "hello"
}
```

**Fix 3: Convert the value**
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = parse_int("42")
}
```
