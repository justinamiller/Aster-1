NOTES

- This is the canonical seed compiler for Aster Stage 0
- It compiles Aster source code to native binaries via LLVM
- It is used to bootstrap Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 compilers
- Once Stage 3 is stable, this seed is used only for recovery
- The seed compiler will be maintained indefinitely for reproducibility
